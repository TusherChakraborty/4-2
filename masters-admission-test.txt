Ok, so I'm running low on both facts and ideas...everybody chip in please :)
If anyone has talked to immediate seniors about the admission test, kindly get in touch with me via gmail (saquib2527).
I'll update the contents accordingly.

General Info
------------
* 30 questions (2 from each topic - see CSE notice board for list) each having 5 marks: (5 * 30 = 150)
* (??)90 minutes time (each question 3 minutes - that's tough)
* if you manage to get 40 out of 150 (yes, that's 40 - not 140) you are pretty much getting into masters program
* the highest marks is generally around 80 (so 40 isn't that low actually :p)


Tentative Lesson Plan
---------------------
1. DLD:
	- function implementation, function reduction using K-map
	- comparator design
	- Flip Flops
	- Counters

2. Database:
	- CRUD
	- write ahead
	- basic queries
	- constraints
	- ER diagram
	- ACID principle

3. Algorithm:
	- basic algos like sorting/bfs/dfs
	- in general simulations might come (last year merge sort and DFS traversal was given)

4. OOP:
	- implementing java method (so we can infer that language specific questions might actually come)
	- finding errors in a given code
	- function overloading and overriding difference
	- friend function

5. ISD:
	- design patterns (Ashik Azim Sir recommended not to study, as chances are we won't be able to answer them anyways :p)

6. Computer Architecture
	- pipelining
	- virtual memory/address
	- cache

7. OS:
	- basics

8. Structural Programming:
	- #define in C

9. Discrete Math:
	- pigeonhole principle

10. Data Structure:
	- post/pre/in-order traversal of BST

11. Software Engineering:
	- Critical Path Method (CPM) and PERT chart

12. Network Comm:
	- TCP/UDP
	- IP address
	- Hamming Code
	- Sliding Window Protocol

13. Compiler and Automata:
	- Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
	- Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
	- Regular Expression
	- Context Free Grammar
	- Parse tree

14. AI:

15. Microprocessor/Microcontroller:
